        (10 points) Project overview that contains about 1 paragraph describing
        the service
        <p>
          The service we plan to implement is NextCloud. NextCloud of a
          self-hosted, open-source file sharing and collaboration platform that
          allows for users and organizations to securely sotre, sync, and sheare
          documents, emails, calendars, and mreo. This service allows for a lot
          of customization to make it your own. We intend to simulate the use fo
          this service for business or organization that want to ensure that all
          data remains inside the company on their personal services.
