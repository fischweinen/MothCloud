          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The service we plan to implement is NextCloud. NextCloud of a
            self-hosted, open-source file sharing and collaboration platform
            that allows for users and organizations to securely store, sync, and
            share documents, emails, calendars, and more. This service allows
            for a lot of customization to make it your own. We intend to
            simulate the use of this service for business or organization that
            want to ensure that all data remains inside the company on their
            personal services.

          <h4>1. The names of your general user group and your admin group</h4>
          MothCloud Users
          <br />
          MothCloud Admin
          <br />
          MothCloud HR
          <h4>
            2. The resources that are restricted by your group ownership
            settings
          </h4>
          The resource that is restricted by our group ownership settings is the
          mothcloud folder that contains all the nextcloud database, config
          files, and all hosting information for nextcloud. We created 3 groups,
          mothcloudadmin, mothcloud-hr and mothcloud-user. By using a command
          called acl we were able to set specific permissions for each group
          without making them own it which would have messed up our apache
          configuration as nextcloud needs to be owned by www-data and part of
          that group as well. We made it so under acl, mothcloudadmin can
          read,write and execute; mothcloud-hr can read and execuate; and that a
          mothcloud-user can't access the files at all.
          <h4>
            3. What the script in Question 1C automates and where the script is
            saved on your VM
          </h4>
          The script that is in question 1C is a script to automate the process
          of updating our static website. We wrote a bash script that git pulls
          from the repository that our static website is in, and sets the
          permissions for the website so apache can access the files and then
          restarts apache to update the website with the new information. After
          that we used cron to schedule this process to happen every 24 hours.
          This bash script is located in the home directory as
          "update-webpage.sh"
          <h4>
            4. Which system features you are logging, how you are logging them,
            and where the log files are stored
          </h4>
          The system features we chose to log are User Access Logs, Disk Space,
          and Memory Usage. Using crontab we have scheduled the script to run
          every six hours. The log files are stored in /var/log.
          <h4>6. Where your backup script is stored and what its backing up</h4>
          The backup script is stored in the scripting directory. We are backing
          up all data in the NextCloud server.
